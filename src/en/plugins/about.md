# Regarding paid plugins

Mind map is an open-source project under the MIT protocol. In theory, as long as the copyright statement of mind map is retained, there is no charge for commercial use, and this protocol will not be changed in the future. 

Moreover, neither the online version nor the client will consider charging. 

However, in order to ensure the sustainable development of the project, revenue will be obtained through various means, such as existing sponsorship methods. The second approach is to use paid plugins, with the basic principle that basic functions, core functions, and necessary functions are not charged, while optional additional functions may be charged.

Finally, the fee is only applicable to developers. If it is only the online version or client version of the mind map, users do not need to pay, and all functions can be used for free.

## Price

At present, the price of a single plugin is ￥29.9, which includes source code and packaged files that you can reference as needed.

At present, there are a total of four paid plugins, with a total purchase price of ￥119.6 yuan per unit. Purchasing all of them can offer a discount of ￥20 yuan for only ￥99.9 yuan. What are you waiting for? Hurry up and take action~
