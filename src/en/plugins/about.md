# Regarding paid plugins

Mind map is an open-source project under the MIT protocol. In theory, as long as the copyright statement of mind map is retained, there is no charge for commercial use, and this protocol will not be changed in the future. 

Moreover, neither the online version nor the client will consider charging. 

But for the sustainable development of the project, there will be some ways to obtain profits, such as the existing sponsorship methods. However, the number of people willing to sponsor is always small, so there are paid plugins.

Plugin fees are only applicable to developers. If it is only the online or client-side mind map user, there is no need to pay, and all functions can be used for free.

## Price

At present, the price of a single plugin is ï¿¥29.9, which includes source code and packaged files that you can reference as needed.

Buy 4 or more at once and get 20% off. It's better to take action than to be tempted~
