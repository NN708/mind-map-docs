You can also experience it in the online version by activating the node first, and then clicking the 【notation】 button above to add a notation.

The internal implementation is done through the [rough-notation](https://github.com/rough-stuff/rough-notation) library, so if you have the energy, you can also implement this plugin based on this library yourself.

// 或 import Notation from 'notation.esm.min.js'

MindMap.usePlugin(Notation)
```

2.Referencing Unpackaged Source Code

You can first enter the plugin directory to execute:

```

Then enter your project root directory to execute:

```

Then you can directly import it for use:

```js
import MindMap from 'simple-mind-map'
import Notation from 'simple-mind-map-plugin-notation'

MindMap.usePlugin(Notation)
```

After registration and instantiation of `MindMap`, the instance can be obtained through `mindMap.notation`.

If you are using the mindMap.addPlugin method to dynamically register a component, you will need to call the method for re rendering once:

```js
mindMap.addPlugin(Notation)
mindMap.reRender()
```

## Command

After registering this plugin, the 'SET_NOTATION' command will be added to the mind map instance to set node numbers. Use this command:

```js
mindMap.execCommand('SET_NOTATION', appointNodes, show, config)
```

This command can pass three parameters:

- `appointNodes`：Assign a number to a specified node instance, which can be passed as a single node instance or as an array of node instances. If an empty array is passed, a notation will be added to the currently activated node;

- `show`：Boolean，Required transmission, whether to display the notation;

- `config`：Object，Optional, notation configuration, object format, detailed fields of the object are as follows:

| Field name | Type  | Default | Desc |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| type | String | circle | Tag type, optional values: underline, box, circle, highlight, strike-through, crossed-off |
| color | String | 'hoverRectColor' configuration in mind map instantiation options | Color |
| strokeWidth | Number | 1 | Line width |
| padding | Number | 20 | Padding |
| animate | Boolean | true | Is enable animation |

Example:

```js
// Add a circular marker to the currently activated node
mindMap.execCommand('SET_NOTATION', [], true, {
    type: 'circle',
    color: 'red'
})
```

After adding tags, the data will be saved to the node's 'data'under the name 'notation'.
