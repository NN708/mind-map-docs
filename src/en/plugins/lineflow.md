# Lineflow plugin

> v0.12.2+

This plugin is used to support the flow effect of node connections. The flow effect only takes effect when the connection is dashed, and the effect is as follows:

You can experience it in the online version, which can be set in the "Basic Style" or "Node Style" sidebar.

## Register

1.Referencing packaged files:

```js
import MindMap from 'simple-mind-map'
import Lineflow from 'lineflow.cjs.min.js'
// 或 import Lineflow from 'lineflow.esm.min.js'

MindMap.usePlugin(Lineflow)
```

2.Referencing Unpackaged Source Code

You can first enter the plugin directory to execute:

```bash
npm link
```

Then enter your project root directory to execute:

```bash
npm link simple-mind-map-plugin-lineflow
```

Then you can directly import it for use:

```js
import MindMap from 'simple-mind-map'
import Lineflow from 'simple-mind-map-plugin-lineflow'

MindMap.usePlugin(Lineflow)
```

After registration and instantiation of `MindMap`, the instance can be obtained through `mindMap.lineflow`.

If you are using the mindMap.addPlugin method to dynamically register a component, you will need to call the method for re rendering once:

```js
mindMap.addPlugin(Lineflow)
mindMap.reRender()
```

## Describe

### Config

The flow effect configuration ultimately reflects three fields on the theme:

```js
{
   // Whether to activate the flow effect, only valid when dashed
  lineFlow: false,
  // The duration of one cycle of flow effect, unit: s
  lineFlowDuration: 1,
  // Is the flow direction positive, from the parent node to the child node
  lineFlowForward: true
}
```

### Warm reminder

1. If you want to activate the flow effect of all dashed lines, you can modify the relevant methods of theme configuration;

2. The priority of individual node settings is higher than the overall settings;

3. For more complex dashed lines, there may be fluctuations in the flow effect;

4. There may be issues with the flow of directory organization charts, organizational structure charts, and horizontal lines;

## Usage

### Enable or update the flow effect of all connections

To achieve this function, it is actually to modify the flow effect related fields in the theme configuration.

```js
const customConfig = {
    lineFlow: false,
    lineFlowDuration: 1,
    lineFlowForward: true
    // Other theme config...
}

const update = (prop, value) => {
    customConfig[prop] = value
    mindMap.setThemeConfig({
        ...customConfig
    })
}

// Activate the flow effect
update('lineFlow', true)
```

To obtain the current configuration, you can use the `getThemeConfig` method:

```js
Object.keys(customConfig).forEach(key => {
    customConfig[key] = mindMap.getThemeConfig(key)
})
```

### Enable or update the flow effect of specified nodes

To achieve this function, it is actually to update the data of the node itself:

```js
let activeNodes = []
mindMap.on('node_active', (node, nodeList) => {
    activeNodes = [...nodeList]
})

const nodeConfig = {
    lineFlow: false,
    lineFlowDuration: 1,
    lineFlowForward: true
    // Other node config...
}
const update = (prop, value) =>  {
    nodeConfig[prop] = value
    activeNodes.forEach(node => {
        node.setStyle(prop, value)
    })
}
```

To retrieve data, you can use the 'getStyle' method of the node:

```js
Object.keys(nodeConfig).forEach(item => {
    nodeConfig[item] = activeNodes[0].getStyle(item, false)
})
```

Of course, plugins also provide a method to update:

```js
mindMap.lineflow.updateNodeLineFlow(activeNodes, {
    ...nodeConfig
})
```

## Methods

### updateNodeLineFlow(appointNodes, config = {})

- `appointNodes`: A single node instance, or an array of node instances, can pass an empty array representing the settings for the currently activated node

- `config`: Flow effect setting, object type, can only pass partial fields, structure as follows:

```js
{
    lineFlow: false,// Does the dashed line enable the flow effect
    lineFlowDuration: 1,// The duration of one cycle of a connected animation, unit: s
    lineFlowForward: true,// Is the flow direction from the parent node to the child node
}
```

Update the flow effect settings for the specified node.
