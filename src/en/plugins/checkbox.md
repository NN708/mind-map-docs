After registering this plugin, the 'SET_CHECKBOX' command will be added to the mind map instance to set node numbers. Use this command:

```js
mindMap.execCommand('SET_CHECKBOX', appointNodes, checkboxData)
```

This command can pass two parameters:

- `appointNodes`：Set to-do data for a specified node instance, which can be passed as a single node instance or as an array of node instances. If an empty array is passed, a to-do will be added to the currently activated node;

- `checkboxData`：To set the to-do data, if 'null' is passed, it means deleting the to-do. Otherwise, please pass an object with the following detailed fields:

| Field name | Type  | Desc |
| ------- | ----- | ---- |
| done | Boolean | Has the to-do list been completed |

Example:

```js
mindMap.execCommand('SET_CHECKBOX', [], {
   done: false
})
```

After setting the number, the data will be saved to the node's' data 'under the name 'checkbox'.
