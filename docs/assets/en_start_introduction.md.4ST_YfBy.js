In addition, when the number of nodes is very large, there may be some performance issues. Because everyone can accept different levels of congestion, you can test the maximum number of nodes yourself. Generally speaking, within 500 nodes, it is more smooth, while over 1000 nodes have more noticeable lag.</p><p>In v0.10.4+version, a performance mode has been added to only render nodes within the visible area of the canvas, which can improve rendering speed under large data volumes. You can experience it by turning on the &#39;openPerformance&#39; instantiation option, and in the online demo, you can turn on the &#39;Basic Styles&#39; - &#39;Enable Performance Mode&#39; switch.</p><p>If you have suggestions or find bugs, you can submit <a href="https://github.com/wanglin2/mind-map/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">issues</a> here.</p><p>The built-in themes and icons in the project part come from:<a href="https://naotu.baidu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Baidu Mind Map</a>、<a href="https://www.zhixi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Zhixi Mind Map</a>。Respect the copyright, and do not use the theme and icons directly for commercial projects.</p><h2 id="why-not" tabindex="-1">Why not？ <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-not" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why not？&quot;">​</a></h2><p>1.<a href="https://www.zhixi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Zhixi</a></p><p>Zhixi is a free mind mapping product that supports multi end synchronization. The UI design is beautiful and the features are complete, but it is not open source, so it can only be used as a user and cannot be used in your project.</p><p>There are many other online mind mapping products similar to Zhixi, such as <a href="https://gitmind.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitMind</a>、<a href="http://www.mindline.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MindLine</a>、<a href="https://www.mindmeister.com/zh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MinMeister</a>、<a href="https://mubu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mubu</a> and so on, There are many searches on search engines, but these products either require fees or are developed by small companies, and their stability and sustainability cannot be guaranteed.

It has powerful functions and good performance, but it is no longer maintained. Therefore, the code is relatively old, and the interface beauty is relatively ordinary. In addition, bugs can only be fixed by yourself, and the functions can only be developed by yourself. It has high requirements for front-end development capabilities.</p><p>3.<a href="https://github.com/hizzgdev/jsmind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">jsmind</a>、<a href="https://github.com/ssshooter/mind-elixir-core" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mind-elixir</a>、<a href="https://github.com/ondras/my-mind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">my-mind</a>、<a href="https://github.com/awehook/blink-mind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">blink-mind</a>、<a href="https://github.com/luvsic3/remind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">remind</a>、<a href="https://github.com/hellowuxin/vue3-mindmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">vue3-mindmap</a>、<a href="https://github.com/zyascend/ZMindMap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ZMindMap</a>、<a href="https://github.com/RockyRen/mindmaptree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">mindmaptree</a>...</p><p>These open-source mind maps are also good, each with its own characteristics, but they also have certain drawbacks, such as stopping updates, average interface aesthetics, less functionality, relying on a certain framework, and so on.</p><p>In summary, in open-source mind maps, it is difficult to find a better choice than <code>simple-mind-map</code>.
